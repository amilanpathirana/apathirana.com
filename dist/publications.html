          <p>
            The presence of a fault current source in the low voltage
            distribution level is a major challenge for the protection system
            designers. This project studied such systems in detail through
            simulations. Once the key network response trends were identified,
            novel protection and relaying schemes were proposed and validated
            through simulations. The contributions include developing an
            improved protection method for active distribution networks.

            Transient based protection schemes require suitable sensors to
            detect the high frequency signals. In this work, a new type of
            sensor is proposed to detect high frequency transients in currents
            and their initial polarities. Key component of the sensor is an open
            circuited ferrite core coil. A detailed model of the sensor,
            including the dynamic hysteresis characteristics of the ferrite
            coil, is modeled in electromagnetic transient simulation platform.
            Finally, the model is verified using experimental measurements.

            This paper investigates the application of a transient based unit
            protection scheme to implement adaptive characteristics on time
            over-current relays. Time over-current relays located upstream have
            longer operating times due to the coordination with the downstream
            relays. This paper proposes a basic concept of using transient based
            protection methods to improve the operation times of time
            over-current relays.

          <p>
            Implementing a protection scheme that relies on transient signals in
            the laboratory environment and demonstrating its performance using
            hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations is an important step needed
            for real world application of transient based protection methods. In
            this project, transient-based protection scheme was implemented in a
            laboratory. Implementation comprised of power network simulated in
            Real Time Digital Simulation (RTDS) platform, commercial relays
            (SEL-421) and transient detection sensors. This work further
            verifies the use of transient based protection strategies for
            protection applications in active distribution networks.

          <p>
            This paper investigates travelling wave based fault location in
            voltage source converter (VSC) based HVDC schemes. The selection of
            appropriate input signals and transducers can potentially increase
            the accuracy of fault location while reducing the cost and the
            complexity of the measurement system. Most commercial HVDC line
            fault locators are designed for traditional line commutated
            convertor (LCCs) based HVDC schemes where there is a large smoothing
            reactor between the converter and the DC line. This allows easy
            detection of fault generated voltage waves by monitoring the current
            through the surge capacitors connected at the line ends. In VSC HVDC
            schemes, large smoothing inductors are not necessary and much
            smaller series inductors may be included for protection purposes.
            This paper examined the adaptations that may be required to the
            measurement methods when employed for fault location in VSC based
            systems. The studies showed that the surge capacitor currents can be
            used as a signal to detect wave fronts in VSC based HVDC schemes as
            well, provided that a small series inductor is present between the
            line and converter terminal.
