              This project focused on designing and training NN to classify
              different types of transient faults in a power network. Training
              and testing data is obtained by simulating a power network in
              PSCAD power system simulation software. The trained NN was able to
              classify different types of transient faults with excellent
              accuracy. Selecting a few suitable inputs from large range of
              available input parameters is one of the main targets of the
              project.

              The presence of a fault current source in the low voltage
              distribution level is a major challenge for the protection system
              designers. This project studied such systems in detail through
              simulations. Once the key network response trends identified,
              novel protection and relaying scheme was proposed and then
              validated through simulations. The contributions include
              developing an improved hybrid protection method for active
              distribution networks.

              Transient based protection schemes require suitable sensors to
              detect the high frequency signals. In this work, a new type of
              sensor is proposed to detect high frequency transients in currents
              and their initial polarities. Key component of the sensor is an
              open circuited ferrite core coil. A detailed model of the sensor,
              including the dynamic hysteresis characteristics of the ferrite
              coil, is modeled in electromagnetic transient simulation platform.
              Finally, the model is verified using experimental measurements.
