            Graduate from the University of Manitoba, Canada. I am an expert in
            electrical protection design and simulation as well as power system
            analysis. I am also expert in power system modelling & simulation
            sofware packages such as PSCAD, PSSE and RTDS.

          <p>
            In this project i work with simulation and protection engineers at
            Manitoba Hydro International. Main objective was to test the
            accuracy and proper operation of protection relay model library
            developed by developed by the company. The workflow consisted of
            creating suitable test scenarios in PSCAD power system simulation
            software to evaluate the proper operation of protection relay
            models. The testing was carried out on Distance relays, Over-current
            relays, Directional over-current relays, Differential relays,
            Generator protection relays & DG Interconnection relays.

            During my work as a Research fellow and research assistant, I
            investigated the use of travelling wave based fault location in
            VSC-HVDC schemes,Implemented protection schemes for active
            distribution networks/micro-grids using PSCAD/EMTDC simulation
            environment,Developed a transient current detection sensor and
            validated using laboratory experiments and Validated the transient
            based protection method using hardware implementation and HIL
            simulation using RTDS
